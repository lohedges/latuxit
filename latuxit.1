.SH NAME
latuxit \- create a cropped LaTeX equation in pdf and postscript format.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B latuxit
.RI [ options ]
.br
.B latuxit
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ FILE ]

.B latuxit
.RI [ FILE ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B LaTuXiT
is a command-line Linux clone of the excellent Mac OS X program
.B LaTeXiT (http://pierre.chachatelier.fr/latexit)
.PP
.B Latuxit
creates cropped
.B pdf
and
.B postscript
images of
.B LaTeX
equations processed by the
.B pdflatex
utility.
.B Latuxit
has full RGB color support and also accepts any of the 68 standard colors known
to
.BR dvips .
Like
.BR LaTeXiT ,
.B latuxit
has reverse editing capability, i.e. one can edit an existing equation by
invoking
.B latuxit
on an image that was generated by
.BR latuxit .
.PP
.B Latuxit
works by hashing each equation string and building a database in
.IR ~/.latuxit/cache/ .
Metadata written to the output
.B pdf
and
.B postscript
images allows
.B latuxit
to match an image to an equation in the database. While it is possible to
directly embedd equations into the output images, inconsistencies in equation
formatting (particularly for long, multi-line equations) makes it difficult to
parse the metadata in a well defined way. Unfortuntely this means that one can
no longer edit an image if the equation cache is deleted or corrupt. In
addition, images are not portable between different machines unless the cache
is also transferred.
.SH OPTIONS
.B
latuxit
supports the following short- and long-form command-line options. Invoking
.B latuxit
with no options will open the editor defined by the
.B LATUXIT_EDITOR
environment variable. The user can then type an equation and
.B latuxit
will proceed as normal once the file has been saved.
.TP
.BI \-e " EQUATION" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-equation "EQUATION
.I EQUATION
in LaTeX markup. No $ symbols are needed. The
.B EQUATION
should be surrounded by double quotation marks, i.e. "\fIOPTION\fP"\fR, to
ensure that it is parsed correctly. When the equation starts with a minus
sign make sure the character is enclosed in curly braces, 
i.e. "\fI{-}...\fP"\fR , so that it isn't mistaken as an identifier for a
command-line argument. If no
.I EQUATION
is passed on the command-line then
.B latuxit
will open the
.I EQUATION
editor defined by the
.B LATUXIT_EDITOR
environment variable. If
.B pdflatex
fails to process an
.I EQUATION
the user will be given the opportunity to edit it using
.BR LATUXIT_EDITOR .
.TP
.BI \-c " COLOR" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-color "COLOR
Where
.I COLOR
is one of the 68 standard colors defined in
.IR ~/.latuxit/latuxit.colors ,
or, alternatively, a
.I COLOR
in {R,G,B} format, where R,G,B=[0\-1.0], or [0\-255]. RGB colors should be
surrounded by double quotation marks, i.e. "\fI{R,G,B}\fP"\fR, to ensure
they are parsed correctly. Also make sure that there aren't any blank spaces
on either side of any of the RGB values.
.TP
.BI \-o " FILE_PREFIX" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-output "FILE_PREFIX
.I FILE_PREFIX
is a prefix used for all output images, e.g
.IR FILE_PREFIX .pdf.
The default is
.BR latuxit .
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\^\-purge
Purge the equation cache.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\^\-help
Get help (loads the man page).
.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B file
Running
.B latuxit
on a
.I FILE
that was previously created with
.B latuxit
will search the file for metadata and open the corresponding equation from the
cache in the editor defined by the
.I LATUXIT_EDITOR
environment variable (see
.B ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
section). This allows the user to modify an existing
.B latuxit
image. The image and equation are overwritten unless a different
.I FILE_PREFIX
is specified.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
Latuxit's behavior is affected by the following environment variables. These
can be sourced from
.I ~/.latuxitrc
or
.IR ~/.latuxit/latuxitrc .
.TP
.B LATUXIT_EDITOR
This variable specifies the editor to be used for typing equations. The default
option is
.BR vim .
.TP
.B LATUXIT_COLOR
The
.I COLOR
of the equation. The default is
.BR Black ,
but the command line option
.B \-c
will take precedence.
.TP
.B LATUXIT_CACHE_SIZE
The size of the
.B latuxit
.I EQUATION
cache. The default is 1000.
.TP
.B LATUXIT_POSTSCRIPT
Whether to save a postscript copy of the output image. The default is
.BR true .
.TP
.B LATUXIT_PURGE_CONFIRMATION
Whether to ask for confirmation before purging the equation cache. The default
is
.BR true .

.SH BUGS
.PP
.B latuxit
metadata is written as a comment to the bottom of the
.B pdf
and
.B postscript
image files. While this doesn't cause problems with the viewers for which
.B latuxit
has been tested, this may cause issues in some rare cases.
