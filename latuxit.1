.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B latuxit
is a command-line Linux clone of the excellent Mac OS X program
.B LaTeXiT (http://pierre.chachatelier.fr/latexit)
.PP
.B latuxit
creates cropped
.B PDF
and
.B PostScript
images of
.B LaTeX
typset equations processed by the
.B pdflatex
utility.
.B latuxit
has full RGB color support and also accepts any of the 68 standard colors known
to
.BR dvips .
Like
.BR LaTeXiT ,
.B latuxit
has reverse editing capability, i.e. one can edit an existing equation by
invoking
.B latuxit
on an image that was generated by
.BR latuxit .
Due to its command-line nature,
.B latuxit
provides a handy way of processing many equations from a batch script.
.PP
.B latuxit
works by hashing each equation string and building a library of equations in
.IR ~/.latuxit/library/ .
Metadata written to the output
.B PDF
and
.B PostScript
images allows
.B latuxit
to match an image to an equation in the library. While it is possible to
directly embed equations into the output images, inconsistencies in equation
formatting (particularly for long, multi-line equations) makes it difficult to
parse the metadata in a well defined way. Unfortuntely this means that one can
no longer edit an image if the equation library is deleted or corrupt. In
addition, images are not portable between different machines unless the library
is also transferred.
.PP
Due to the limited range of font sizes supported by LaTeX,
.B latuxit
uses the default size of 10pt. Since equations are output as vector images it
is trivial to rescale them afterwards.
.SH OPTIONS
.B
latuxit
supports the following short- and long-form command-line options. Invoking
.B latuxit
when no equation has been passed using the command-line option or via stdin
will open the editor defined by the
.B LATUXIT_EDITOR
environment variable. The user can then type an equation and
.B latuxit
will proceed as normal once the file has been saved and closed.
.TP
.BI \-e " EQUATION" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-equation "EQUATION
.I EQUATION
in LaTeX markup. No $ symbols are needed. The
.I EQUATION
should be surrounded by double quotation marks, i.e. "\fIEQUATION\fP"\fR, to
ensure that it is parsed correctly. When the equation starts with a minus
sign make sure the character is enclosed in curly braces,
i.e. "\fI{-}...\fP"\fR , so that it isn't mistaken as an identifier for a
command-line argument. If the line break command
.B \e\e
is needed, e.g. in a matrix, then three backslashes should be used to ensure
that the equation is parsed correctly, i.e.
.BR \e\e\e .
If no
.I EQUATION
is passed on the command-line or from stdin then
.B latuxit
will open the
.I EQUATION
editor defined by the
.B LATUXIT_EDITOR
environment variable. If
.B pdflatex
fails to process an
.I EQUATION
then the user will be given the opportunity to edit it again in order to
correct any mistakes.
.TP
.BI \-c " COLOR" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-color "COLOR
Where
.I COLOR
is one of the 68 standard colors defined in
.IR ~/.latuxit/latuxit.colors ,
or, alternatively, a
.I COLOR
in {R,G,B} format, where R,G,B=[0\-1.0], or [0\-255]. RGB colors should be
surrounded by double quotation marks, i.e. "\fI{R,G,B}\fP"\fR, to ensure
they are parsed correctly. Also make sure that there aren't any blank spaces
on either side of any of the RGB values.
.TP
.BI \-o " FILE_PREFIX" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-output "FILE_PREFIX
.I FILE_PREFIX
is a prefix used for all output images, e.g
.IR FILE_PREFIX .pdf.
The default is
.BR latuxit .
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\^\-list
Lists all equations in the library along with their hash.
.TP
.BI \-s " EQUATION" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-search "EQUATION
Searches the equation library for all partial matches of
.IR EQUATION .
The matches are output along with the corresponding hash.
.TP
.BI \-m " HASH" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-md5 "HASH
Run
.B latuxit
in "hash" mode. The
.I HASH
string is matched against equations in the library. It should be long enough to
ensure a unique match. Once a match is found,
.B latuxit
will open the equation for editing with
.BR LATUXIT_EDITOR .
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\^\-purge
Purge the equation library.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\^\-help
Get help (loads the man page).
.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B image
Running
.B latuxit
on an
.I IMAGE
that was previously created with
.B latuxit
will search the file for metadata and open the corresponding equation from the
library in the editor defined by the
.I LATUXIT_EDITOR
environment variable (see
.B ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
section). This allows the user to modify an existing
.B latuxit
image. The image and equation are overwritten unless a different
.I FILE_PREFIX
is specified.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.B latuxit's
behavior is affected by the following environment variables. These
can be sourced from
.I ~/.latuxitrc
or
.IR ~/.latuxit/latuxitrc .
.TP
.B LATUXIT_EDITOR
This variable specifies the editor to be used for typing equations. The default
option is
.BR vim .
.TP
.B LATUXIT_COLOR
The
.I COLOR
of the equation. The default is
.BR Black ,
but the command-line option
.B \-c
will take precedence.
.TP
.B LATUXIT_LIBRARY_SIZE
The size of the
.B latuxit
.I EQUATION
library. The default is 1000.
.TP
.B LATUXIT_POSTSCRIPT
Whether to also save a PostScript copy of the output PDF. The default is
.BR true .
.TP
.B LATUXIT_PURGE_CONFIRMATION
Whether to ask for confirmation before purging the equation library. The default
is
.BR true .
