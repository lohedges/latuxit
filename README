NAME
       latuxit - create a cropped LaTeX equation in pdf and postscript format.

SYNOPSIS
       latuxit [options]
       latuxit [options] [FILE]
       latuxit [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       LaTuXiT is a command-line Linux clone of the excellent Mac OS X program
       LaTeXiT (http://pierre.chachatelier.fr/latexit)

       Latuxit creates cropped pdf and postscript images  of  LaTeX  equations
       processed  by the pdflatex utility.  Latuxit has full RGB color support
       and also accepts any of the 68 standard colors known  to	 dvips.	  Like
       LaTeXiT,	 latuxit  has reverse editing capability, i.e. one can edit an
       existing equation by invoking latuxit on an image that was generated by
       latuxit.

       Latuxit	works  by hashing each equation string and building a database
       in ~/.latuxit/cache/.  Metadata written to the  output  pdf  and	 post‐
       script  images  allows  latuxit to match an image to an equation in the
       database. While it is possible to directly  embed  equations  into  the
       output images, inconsistencies in equation formatting (particularly for
       long, multi-line equations) makes it difficult to parse the metadata in
       a well defined way. Unfortuntely this means that one can no longer edit
       an image if the equation cache is  deleted  or  corrupt.	 In  addition,
       images  are not portable between different machines unless the cache is
       also transferred.

OPTIONS
       latuxit	supports  the  following  short-  and  long-form  command-line
       options.	 Invoking latuxit with no options will open the editor defined
       by the LATUXIT_EDITOR environment variable. The user can then  type  an
       equation	 and  latuxit  will  proceed  as normal once the file has been
       saved.

       -e EQUATION, --equation EQUATION
	      EQUATION in LaTeX markup. No $ symbols are needed. The  EQUATION
	      should  be  surrounded by double quotation marks, i.e. "OPTION",
	      to ensure that it is parsed correctly. When the equation	starts
	      with  a  minus sign make sure the character is enclosed in curly
	      braces, i.e. "{-}..." , so that it isn't mistaken as an  identi‐
	      fier  for	 a  command-line argument. If no EQUATION is passed on
	      the command-line then latuxit  will  open	 the  EQUATION	editor
	      defined  by the LATUXIT_EDITOR environment variable. If pdflatex
	      fails to process an EQUATION the user will be given the opportu‐
	      nity to edit it using LATUXIT_EDITOR.

       -c COLOR, --color COLOR
	      Where  COLOR  is	one  of	 the  68  standard  colors  defined in
	      ~/.latuxit/latuxit.colors, or, alternatively, a COLOR in {R,G,B}
	      format,  where  R,G,B=[0-1.0],  or [0-255]. RGB colors should be
	      surrounded by double quotation marks, i.e. "{R,G,B}", to	ensure
	      they  are parsed correctly. Also make sure that there aren't any
	      blank spaces on either side of any of the RGB values.

       -o FILE_PREFIX, --output FILE_PREFIX
	      FILE_PREFIX  is  a  prefix  used	for  all  output  images,  e.g
	      FILE_PREFIX.pdf.	The default is latuxit.

       -p, --purge
	      Purge the equation cache.

       -h, --help
	      Get help (loads the man page).

FILES
       file   Running  latuxit	on  a  FILE  that  was previously created with
	      latuxit will search the file for metadata and  open  the	corre‐
	      sponding	equation  from	the cache in the editor defined by the
	      LATUXIT_EDITOR environment variable (see	ENVIRONMENT  VARIABLES
	      section).	 This  allows  the  user to modify an existing latuxit
	      image. The image and equation are overwritten unless a different
	      FILE_PREFIX is specified.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Latuxit's  behavior is affected by the following environment variables.
       These can be sourced from ~/.latuxitrc or ~/.latuxit/latuxitrc.

       LATUXIT_EDITOR
	      This variable specifies the editor to be used for	 typing	 equa‐
	      tions. The default option is vim.

       LATUXIT_COLOR
	      The COLOR of the equation. The default is Black, but the command
	      line option -c will take precedence.

       LATUXIT_CACHE_SIZE
	      The size of the latuxit EQUATION cache. The default is 1000.

       LATUXIT_POSTSCRIPT
	      Whether to save a postscript  copy  of  the  output  image.  The
	      default is true.

       LATUXIT_PURGE_CONFIRMATION
	      Whether  to  ask	for  confirmation  before purging the equation
	      cache. The default is true.

BUGS
       latuxit metadata is written as a comment to the bottom of the  pdf  and
       postscript  image  files.  While	 this  doesn't cause problems with the
       viewers for which latuxit has been tested, this	may  cause  issues  in
       some rare cases.
