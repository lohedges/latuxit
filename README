NAME
       latuxit	-  create a cropped LaTeX equation in pdf and
       postscript format.

SYNOPSIS
       latuxit [options]
       latuxit [options] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       LaTuXiT is a command-line Linux clone of the excellent
       Mac  OS	X  program  LaTeXiT  (http://pierre.chachate‐
       lier.fr/latexit)

       Latuxit creates cropped pdf and postscript  images  of
       LaTeX  equations	 processed  by	the pdflatex utility.
       Latuxit has full RGB color support  and	also  accepts
       any  of	the  68 standard colors known to dvips.	 Like
       LaTeXiT, latuxit has reverse editing capability,	 i.e.
       one  can edit an existing equation by invoking latuxit
       on an image that was generated by latuxit.

       Latuxit works by	 hashing  each	equation  string  and
       building	 a  database  in ~/.latuxit/cache/.  Metadata
       written to the output pdf and postscript images allows
       latuxit	to match an image to an equation in the data‐
       base. While it is possible to  directly	embedd	equa‐
       tions into the output images, inconsistencies in equa‐
       tion formatting	(particularly  for  long,  multi-line
       equations) makes it difficult to parse the metadata in
       a well defined way. Unfortuntely this means  that  one
       can  no	longer edit an image if the equation cache is
       deleted or corrupt. In addition, images are not porta‐
       ble  between  different	machines  unless the cache is
       also transferred.

OPTIONS
       latuxit supports the following  short-  and  long-form
       command-line options. All options should be surrounded
       by double quotation marks, i.e.	"OPTION",  to  ensure
       that  they are parsed correctly. Invoking latuxit with
       no  options  will  open	the  editor  defined  by  the
       LATUXIT_EDITOR environment variable. The user can then
       type an equation and latuxit will  proceed  as  normal
       once the file has been saved.

       -e=EQUATION, --equation=EQUATION
	      EQUATION	in  LaTeX  markup.  No	$ symbols are
	      needed.

       -c=COLOR, --color=COLOR
	      Where COLOR is one of the	 68  standard  colors
	      defined in ~/.latuxit/latuxit.colors, or alter‐
	      natively	a  COLOR  in  {R,G,B}  format,	where
	      R,G,B=[0-1.0], or [0-255].

       -o=FILE_PREFIX, --output=FILE_PREFIX
	      FILE_PREFIX  is  a  prefix  used for all output
	      images, e.g FILE_PREFIX.pdf.   The  default  is
	      latuxit.

       -p, --purge
	      Purge the equation cache.

       -h, --help
	      Get help (loads the man page).

FILES
       file   Running  latuxit	on a FILE that was previously
	      created with latuxit will search the  file  for
	      metadata	and  open  the corresponding equation
	      from the cache using the editor defined by  the
	      LATUXIT_EDITOR  environment variable (see ENVI‐
	      RONMENT VARIABLES	 section).  This  allows  the
	      user  to	modify an existing latuxit image. The
	      image and equation  are  overwritten  unless  a
	      different FILE_PREFIX is specified.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Latuxit's  behavior is affected by the following envi‐
       ronment variables. These can be sourced from ~/.latux‐
       itrc or ~/.latuxit/latuxitrc.

       LATUXIT_EDITOR
	      This  variable  specifies the editor to be used
	      for typing equations.  The  default  option  is
	      vim.

       LATUXIT_COLOR
	      The  COLOR  of  the  equation.  The  default is
	      Black, but the command line option -c will take
	      precedence.

       LATUXIT_CACHE_SIZE
	      The  size	 of  the  latuxit EQUATION cache. The
	      default is 1000.

       LATUXIT_POSTSCRIPT
	      Whether to save a postscript copy of the output
	      image. The default is true.

       LATUXIT_PURGE_CONFIRMATION
	      Whether  to ask for confirmation before purging
	      the equation cache. The default is true.

BUGS
       latuxit	currently  doesn't  have  very	sophisticated
       error  handling.	 In  particular,  it will hang if the
       EQUATION is  malformed  and  cannot  be	processed  by
       pdflatex.   In  this  situtation the user can abort by
       pressing CTRL+D twice.

       latuxit metadata is written as a comment to the bottom
       of  the	pdf  and  postscript image files. Whilst this
       doesn't cause problems  with  the  viewers  for	which
       latuxit has been tested, this may cause issues in some
       rare cases.
