DESCRIPTION
       latuxit is a command-line Linux clone of the excellent Mac OS X program
       LaTeXiT (http://pierre.chachatelier.fr/latexit)

       latuxit creates cropped PDF and PostScript images of LaTeX typset equa‐
       tions  processed	 by  the pdflatex utility.  latuxit has full RGB color
       support and also accepts any of the 68 standard colors known to	dvips.
       Like LaTeXiT, latuxit has reverse editing capability, i.e. one can edit
       an existing equation by invoking latuxit on an image that was generated
       by  latuxit.   Due to its command-line nature, latuxit provides a handy
       way of processing many equations from a batch script.

       latuxit works by hashing each equation string and building a library of
       equations  in  ~/.latuxit/library/.  Metadata written to the output PDF
       and PostScript images allows latuxit to match an image to  an  equation
       in  the	library. While it is possible to directly embed equations into
       the output images, inconsistencies in equation formatting (particularly
       for  long,  multi-line equations) makes it difficult to parse the meta‐
       data in a well defined way. Unfortuntely this means  that  one  can  no
       longer  edit an image if the equation library is deleted or corrupt. In
       addition, images are not portable between different machines unless the
       library is also transferred.

       Due to the limited range of font sizes supported by LaTeX, latuxit uses
       the default size of 10pt. Since equations are output as	vector	images
       it is trivial to rescale them afterwards.

OPTIONS
       latuxit	supports  the  following  short-  and  long-form  command-line
       options. Invoking latuxit when no equation has been passed via the com‐
       mand-line  option  or  stdin  will  open	 the  editor  defined  by  the
       LATUXIT_EDITOR environment variable. The user can then type an equation
       and  latuxit  will  proceed  as normal once the file has been saved and
       closed.

       -e EQUATION, --equation EQUATION
	      EQUATION in LaTeX markup. No $ symbols are needed. The  EQUATION
	      should be surrounded by double quotation marks, i.e. "EQUATION",
	      to ensure that it is parsed correctly. When the equation	starts
	      with  a  minus sign make sure the character is enclosed in curly
	      braces, i.e. "{-}..." , so that it isn't mistaken as an  identi‐
	      fier  for	 a command-line argument. If the line break command \\
	      is needed, e.g. in a matrix, then three  backslashes  should  be
	      used to ensure that the equation is parsed correctly, i.e.  \\\.
	      If no EQUATION is passed on the command-line or from stdin  then
	      latuxit	will   open   the   EQUATION  editor  defined  by  the
	      LATUXIT_EDITOR  environment  variable.  If  pdflatex  fails   to
	      process  an EQUATION then the user will be given the opportunity
	      to edit it again in order to correct any mistakes.

       -c COLOR, --color COLOR
	      Where COLOR  is  one  of	the  68	 standard  colors  defined  in
	      ~/.latuxit/latuxit.colors, or, alternatively, a COLOR in {R,G,B}
	      format, where R,G,B=[0-1.0], or [0-255]. RGB  colors  should  be
	      surrounded  by double quotation marks, i.e. "{R,G,B}", to ensure
	      they are parsed correctly. Also make sure that there aren't  any
	      blank spaces on either side of any of the RGB values.

       -o FILE_PREFIX, --output FILE_PREFIX
	      FILE_PREFIX  is  a  prefix  used	for  all  output  images,  e.g
	      FILE_PREFIX.pdf.	The default is latuxit.

       -l, --list
	      Lists all equations in the library along with their hash.

       -s EQUATION, --search EQUATION
	      Searches the equation library for all partial matches  of	 EQUA‐
	      TION.  The matches are output along with the corresponding hash.

       -m HASH, --md5 HASH
	      Run  latuxit  in "hash" mode. The HASH string is matched against
	      equations in the library. It should be long enough to  ensure  a
	      unique match. Once a match is found, latuxit will open the equa‐
	      tion for editing with LATUXIT_EDITOR.

       -p, --purge
	      Purge the equation library.

       -h, --help
	      Get help (loads the man page).

FILES
       image  Running latuxit on an IMAGE that	was  previously	 created  with
	      latuxit  will  search  the file for metadata and open the corre‐
	      sponding equation from the library in the editor defined by  the
	      LATUXIT_EDITOR  environment  variable (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
	      section). This allows the user to	 modify	 an  existing  latuxit
	      image. The image and equation are overwritten unless a different
	      FILE_PREFIX is specified.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       latuxit's behavior is affected by the following environment  variables.
       These can be sourced from ~/.latuxitrc or ~/.latuxit/latuxitrc.

       LATUXIT_EDITOR
	      This  variable  specifies the editor to be used for typing equa‐
	      tions. The default option is vim.

       LATUXIT_COLOR
	      The COLOR of the equation. The default is Black, but the command
	      line option -c will take precedence.

       LATUXIT_LIBRARY_SIZE
	      The size of the latuxit EQUATION library. The default is 1000.

       LATUXIT_POSTSCRIPT
	      Whether  to  also	 save a PostScript copy of the output PDF. The
	      default is true.

       LATUXIT_PURGE_CONFIRMATION
	      Whether to ask for  confirmation	before	purging	 the  equation
	      library. The default is true.
